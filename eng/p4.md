## 关系代词引导的定义

+ 步骤
    1. 主从分离
    2. 找先行词
    3. 找从句缺少的成分
    4. 找关系代词

+ 常用关系代词

| 代词 | 修饰的先行词 | 在从句所作成分| 备注 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| who | 人 | 主/ 宾 | |
| whom | 人 | 宾 | |
| that | 人/ 物 | 主/ 宾/ 表 | |
| which | 物/ 整句话 | 主/ 宾/ 表 | |
| whose | 人/ 物 | 定 | 代表所属关系, 有"的"含义|
| as | 人/ 物/ 整句话 | 主/ 宾/ 表 | 正如, 就像 含义 |

Tips: The boy whose father is a doctor is very clever. (男孩的爸爸, 所属关系)

Tips: Machines can perform the same tasks as human beings. (机器, 就像人一样)

> 在限制性定语从句中当先行词被 such 或 the same 修饰时, 常用 as

+ 特殊用法

    1. 先行词被最高级, 序数词, the only, the very 修饰时, 关系代词用 that
    2. 先行词是 all, anything, everything, nothing, none, much, little, few, many 等不定代词或被他们修饰时, 关系代词用 that
    3. 当主句是 who/ which 开头的疑问句时, 关系代词用 that
    4. 当先行词即有人又有物时, 关系代词用 that
    Tips: They are talking about the man and the dog that live next door. (他们谈论的是, 邻居的那个人和狗)

## 介词 + which/ whom 引导的定语从句

1. whose + 名词 = the + 名词 + of which

Tips: He lives in the house whose roof is leaking. (他住在, 漏水的屋顶的房子里)

=> He lives in the house the roof of which  is leaking.

2. 表示部分词 + of + 关系代词

> 不定代词/ 数词 + of + 关系代词 表示先行词整体中的部分

表示部分的词语有: 不定代词 all, both, none, either, some, any, most, few, several 等, 数词(基数词, 序数词, 百分数, 分数), 数词加名词, the + 最高级/ 比较级

Tips: I borrowed some novels, three of which were English novels.

3. 从句和先行词的习惯搭配

Tips: The person who/ whom/ that she worked with(*介词迁移*) was SongJia.

=> The person with whom she worked  was SongJia.

## 关系副词引导的定语从句

+ 常用关系副词

| 关系副词 | 修饰的先行词 | 在从句所作成分|
| --- | --- | ---|
| when | 表时间 | 时间状语, 介词 + which |
| where | 表地点 | 地点状语, 介词 + which |
| why | 表原因(reason) | 原因状语, for which |

!> **从句不缺主干成分, 用以上关系副词**

1. 先行词为 situation, case, occasion, point 等表示抽象地点 或 地点 用 where

2. 先行词为 the way 时, 若在从句中做方式状语 + in which/ that/ 省略

Tips: Many students didn't understand the way in which/ that/ 省略 I worked out the problem.

## 限制性和非限制性定语从句

!> 非限制性定语从句有括号, 限制性没有

Tips: My elder brother, who is the richest man is busy now.

!> that, why 不可以用来引导非限制性定语从句

> as, which 在非限制性定语从句中都可以指待一整句话, 但 as 为止灵活, which 只能位于先行词之后

Tips: Li Jiaqi is my brother, which is enviable. (李佳琪是我哥哥, 这让人羡慕!)

> as 引导非限制性定语从句
> 1. as we all know/ as is known to all 众所周知
> 2. as we expect/ as is expected 不出所料
> 3. as is mentioned 正如上面所提到的
> 4. as is often the case 通常如此
